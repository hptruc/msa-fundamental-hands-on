# Microservices Practical Project

This repository contains a hands-on project demonstrating a microservices architecture using .NET 8. The project is structured around several services including Product, Order, Identity, and Gateway services. Communication between these services is managed using RabbitMQ with MassTransit, and we implement the transactional outbox pattern and the saga pattern to ensure data consistency and reliable operations.
